### Summary
Innovative researcher and Ph.D. candidate with expertise in computational modeling and advanced imaging methodologies. My doctoral work pushes PET imaging forward through three-gamma (3-γ) reconstruction, positron range correction, and deep learning for inverse problems. With a strong foundation in radiation transport modeling and computation, I am eager to deepen this expertise and contribute to breakthroughs in medical imaging and healthcare technology.

### Core Skills
- **Medical imaging:** Medical physics; reconstruction algorithms; signal and image processing.
- **Deep learning:** CNN, GNN, RNN, transformers, GANs, diffusion models.
- **Programming:** Python, C++, PyTorch.
- **GATE MC simulations:** Scanner geometry definition; source and phantom simulations; large-scale data processing and extraction.

### Experience
- **Ph.D. Student — Laboratory of Medical Information Processing (LaTIM), UMR 1101, Brest, France** (Oct 2021 – Sep 2025)  
  Three-gamma image reconstruction, fast positron tracking, PET positron-range correction, and attention-driven direct PET image reconstruction (TransfRECO). Contributions include GNN-based photon sequencing, non-symmetric Gaussian modeling with Detector Response Error Propagator, transformer-based GANs for particle tracks (10× speedup), and dual-energy attenuation correction to improve activity distribution accuracy.
- **Research Internship — Inria Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France** (Mar 2021 – Sep 2021)  
  Built a machine learning framework for non-infectious uveitis detection and grading in murine OCT images, combining classification with Grad-CAM, multi-method detection, 3D particle reconstruction, and statistical analysis of disease progression.

### Education
- **Ph.D. Student, The University of Western Brittany** (Oct 2021 – Sep 2025) — Three-gamma PET image reconstruction, PR correction, and direct PET reconstruction with deep learning under the supervision of Visvikis Dimitris.  
- **Master 2, Imaging and Technology for Medicine (TechMed), Clermont Auvergne University** (Sep 2020 – Sep 2021).  
- **Biomedical Engineering Degree, Higher School of Biomedical Engineering** (Sep 2017 – Jun 2020).  
- **CPGE — PSI, CPGE Ibnou Taymia** (Sep 2015 – Sep 2017).
