Hi, I’m **Youness Mellak**, a **postdoctoral researcher** working in **medical imaging**, with a focus on **PET image reconstruction**, **positron range correction**, and **physics-informed deep learning for inverse problems**.

My research centers on integrating **learning-based models** with **physical forward operators** to improve image quality and quantitative accuracy in PET. I work on problems such as **positron range (PR) modeling and correction**, **three-gamma PET imaging**, and **direct reconstruction approaches**, with particular emphasis on **matched projector–backprojector formulations** within iterative reconstruction algorithms.

Methodologically, my work spans **Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations (GATE)**, **deep learning architectures** (CNNs, GNNs, transformers, GANs, diffusion models), and **optimization-based reconstruction techniques**. I am especially interested in learning spatially varying operators, embedding learned components into classical reconstruction pipelines, and designing models that respect underlying physical constraints.

I completed my Ph.D. at the **Laboratory of Medical Information Processing (LaTIM, UMR 1101)** in Brest, France, under the supervision of **Prof. Dimitris Visvikis**. I hold a Master’s degree in **Imaging and Technology for Medicine** and a Biomedical Engineering degree, with a strong background in signal processing, inverse problems, and computational physics.

On this website, you can find my **publications**, **research projects**, and links to **code and project pages**. I am always happy to discuss research, collaborations, or technical questions—email is the best way to reach me.
