Hi, I’m **Youness Mellak**, a Ph.D. candidate working on **PET image reconstruction**, **positron range correction**, and **physics-informed deep learning for inverse problems**.

My research focuses on combining **medical physics** and **machine learning** to improve PET image quality, especially for challenging scenarios such as high-energy isotopes and heterogeneous tissues. I work on topics including three-gamma PET imaging, matched projector/backprojector modeling, and direct reconstruction methods using deep neural networks.

I have strong experience with **Monte Carlo simulations (GATE)**, **deep learning (PyTorch)**, and **advanced reconstruction algorithms**, and I’m particularly interested in integrating learned operators into iterative reconstruction frameworks.

You can find my publications below, along with links to my code and project pages.
